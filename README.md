# Dotfiles

This repository contains my humble swiss army knife for getting work done around the shell. It includes config files for vim, zsh, git, and others. Regularly used (and considered tested) only on macOS, but a reduced set of features should also work on Linux e.g. Ubuntu.

## Setup

Usage requires git. Clone the repository (expected into `~/.dotfiles`), and run the [dotbot installer script](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/). This will update all submodules, and create necessary symlinks.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janwh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
sh ~/.dotfiles/install
```
